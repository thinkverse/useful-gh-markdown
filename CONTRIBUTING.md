# Welcome to the contributing guide

To contribute a useful snippet please create a PR with a description of the snippet. The 
addition to the `README.md` should include the snippet itself, a code example, 
a checkbox indicating if the functionality works on the GitHub mobile app 
and optionally a description if the user needs to do a step to view
the functionality working, see [Context Based Images] as an example.
